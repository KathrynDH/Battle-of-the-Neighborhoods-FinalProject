# IBMCapstoneFinalProject
This repository is for the IBM Coursera Applied Data Science capstone project.  

Objective: "Come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve."  

I chose to use KMeans to cluster the 100 most populated metropolitan areas.  
The project consists of 5 notebooks and several json files.  

Notebooks:  
* Part 1 - Get Location Data: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KathrynDH/IBMCapstoneFinalProject/blob/master/Final%20Project%20Get%20Data.ipynb  
* Part 2 - Get Foursquare Data: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KathrynDH/IBMCapstoneFinalProject/blob/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Get%20FourSquare%20Data.ipynb  
* Part 3 - Explore the Location Data: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KathrynDH/IBMCapstoneFinalProject/blob/master/Explore%20Location%20Data.ipynb  
* Part 4 - Cluster Metro Areas: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KathrynDH/IBMCapstoneFinalProject/blob/master/Cluster%20Metro%20Areas.ipynb
